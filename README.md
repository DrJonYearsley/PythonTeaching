# Further Ideas

1. Calculating the length of genes/proteins from sequence data

2. Pattern matching in big data (e.g.  one data set is gene id and gene coordinates, and the second is gene id and description, and you create a third dataframe combining both).

3. Designing plate layout for qPCR analysis (i.e. 96 well plate, each plate must contain x y z) but be randomised. Then once the plate is run, a script to deconvolute the results. 

# Code not intended to be a teaching example

## molecular_weight.ipynb

This code calculate the molecular weight of a molecule from its formula.
It involves regular expressions and is not intended for stage 1 teaching
